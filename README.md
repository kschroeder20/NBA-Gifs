## NBA Gifs

* I created an fun app full of NBA gifs using the giphy api
* Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI
	* I made an array of actions and made buttons out of them.
* When you click on a button, 10 NBA-related images that use the topic displayed on the button are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
* When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
* You can add a new action from the form on the top of the page. The actions will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button
* The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.

### Technology Used:
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* Javascript (AJAX and jQuery)
